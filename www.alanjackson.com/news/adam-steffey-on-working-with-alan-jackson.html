<p><a href="../../bluegrasstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/alan_station1.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-54229];player=img;" title="Alan Jackson at The Station Inn, Ronnie Bowman on harmony vocal (August 27, 2013) - photo by Collin Peterson"><img src="../../bluegrasstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/alan_station1-150x99.jpg" class="alignleft  wp-image-54232" title="Alan Jackson at The Station Inn, Ronnie Bowman on harmony vocal (August 27, 2013) - photo by Collin Peterson" alt="Alan Jackson at The Station Inn, Ronnie Bowman on harmony vocal (August 27, 2013) - photo by Collin Peterson" align="left" height="79" width="120" /></a>Earlier this week, Nashville’s iconic Station Inn was taken over by <a title="Visit Alan Jackson online" href="#">Alan Jackson</a> and his people for two days of rehearsals, sound checks, and video shoots, followed by a <a title="Read more about Alan Jackson at the Station Inn at Bluegrass Today" href="http://bluegrasstoday.com/alan-jackson-does-the-station-inn/">concert Tuesday night</a>. The focus was his upcoming September release, titled simply <em>The Bluegrass Album</em>, which finds the lauded country singer performing with a bluegrass rhythm section for the first time.</p>
<p>And not just any rhythm section. Long-time Jackson producer Keith
Stegall and regular guitarist Scott Coney put together a group drawn
from some of the top pickers and singers in bluegrass, and invited them
to track with Jackson in Nashville this past Spring. Coney handled
guitar, with Sammy Shelor on banjo, Adam Steffey on mandolin, Tim Crouch
 on fiddle, Rob Ickes on reso-guitar, and Tim Dishman on bass. Ronnie
Bowman and Don Rigsby were brought in to provide harmony vocals. All are
 celebrated artists in their own rights, and were happy to participate
in the sessions.</p>
<p>Jackson was so pleased with the results that he invited all of them
back for the August 27 show at the Station Inn, which was broadcast
worldwide on WSM and WSM online. And he’ll take them along on a number
of live appearances in support of the album, starting with a <a title="Check out Alan Jackson at Carnegie Hall online" href="http://www.carnegiehall.org/Calendar/2013/10/28/0800/PM/Alan-Jackson/">Carnegie Hall show</a>
 on October 28. Though nothing has yet been announced, a number of
national television guest spots are anticipated, as well as some major
festival shows.</p>
<p>We spoke yesterday with <a title="Visit Adam Steffey online" href="http://adamsteffey.com/">Adam Steffey</a>, following Tuesday night’s show, and he shared his thoughts about the experience in Nashville.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="../../bluegrasstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/adam_alan.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-54229];player=img;" title="Adam Steffey with Alan Jackson at The Station Inn (August 27, 2013) - photo by Collin Peterson"><img src="../../bluegrasstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/adam_alan-150x99.jpg" class="alignleft  wp-image-54230" title="Adam Steffey with Alan Jackson at The Station Inn (August 27, 2013) - photo by Collin Peterson" alt="Adam Steffey with Alan Jackson at The Station Inn (August 27, 2013) - photo by Collin Peterson" align="left" height="79" width="120" /></a>“It was large…&nbsp;a bunch of fun. We&nbsp;rehearsed all day Monday, and again on Tuesday morning. In the
afternoon we shot two videos at the Station. But&nbsp;when the crowd got in
there, it was great.&nbsp;The show had that live feel – just like the record.&nbsp; This was our first time all together since we cut the album, and we
couldn’t have been treated any better. Alan’s a great guy – very kind –
and he really took care of all of us. All his people, all his crew, were
 first class.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Adam said they shot live performance video for both <em>Blacktop</em>, with which they closed the show Tuesday night, and <em>Blue Ridge Mountain Song</em>.
 Both are Jackson originals, and both will be made into music videos for
 wide distribution this Fall. Additional lighting was installed on
the&nbsp;the Station Inn stage to accommodate the filming. We presume that
additional footage of Jackson will be shot and combined with this live
video to create the finished product.</p>
<p><em>Blacktop</em> is a clever song, very much of the sort that has
seen Jackson score 35 #1 hits, with a simple melody and a relatable
story that can hit home with a lot of country music fans. This one is a
response to the many recent country songs that talk about the glories of
 living on a dirt road, something that Alan actually did growing up. His
 story tells how overjoyed everyone was when their road was finally
paved (“I was glad to see the blacktop, no more dust in my eyes”), set
to a driving bluegrass beat.</p>
<p>One point Steffey returned to repeatedly in our discussion was the
fact that Jackson and his entire apparatus (label, promotion staff, etc)
 are fully committed to <em>The Bluegrass Album</em>, and that it would publicized and distributed as aggressively as any project he has done.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="../../bluegrasstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/adam_station.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-54229];player=img;" title="Tim Crouch, Rob Ickes, Adam Steffey and Ronnie Bowman with Alan Jackson at The Station Inn (August 27, 2013) - photo by Collin Peterson"><img src="../../bluegrasstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/adam_station-150x99.jpg" class="alignleft  wp-image-54235" title="Tim Crouch, Rob Ickes, Adam Steffey and Ronnie Bowman with Alan Jackson at The Station Inn (August 27, 2013) - photo by Collin Peterson" alt="Tim Crouch, Rob Ickes, Adam Steffey and Ronnie Bowman with Alan Jackson at The Station Inn (August 27, 2013) - photo by Collin Peterson" align="left" height="79" width="120" /></a>“He is really into this record – he just really wanted to do it. It’s as important to him as anything he’s ever done. Scott Coney says that Alan’s really jacked about it all, and loves the album.&nbsp; And he wants to enter the bluegrass world the right way,&nbsp;not step on
any toes. Alan has a lot of respect for bluegrass music. He listens to
Sirius Xm all the time on his bus. He told us in the studio that it’s
almost all he listens to, Bluegrass Junction and the classic country
channel. When I first saw him at the Station on Tuesday morning he said,
 “I heard you on XM driving over here.”</p></blockquote>
<p>That would have been Adam’s current CD, <a title="Check out New Primitive in iTunes" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/new-primitive/id647661040?uo=4&amp;at=11l5NM"><em>New Primitive</em></a>, recently released on Mountain Home.</p>
<p>Steffey also mentioned how impressed he was with the fact that
Jackson chose the home of bluegrass in Nashville to introduce the new
record, a venue that leaves much to be desired as compared to the giant
arenas and high tech studios where he is more commonly found.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I have to give him kudos for doing it like that. Before
it’s even released, to do the whole album live and broadcast it
worldwide took a lot of guts. And without any experience playing with a
bluegrass band.”</p></blockquote>
<p>And he was clear in his expectation that <em>The Bluegrass Album</em> will be well-received in the bluegrass world.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I know that we have people in our music who are
superstars at being annoyed by anything different, but I think bluegrass
 fans will really like it.</p>
<p>If any of the songs can break onto country radio, it&nbsp;can only help everybody.</p>
<p>I’m sort of like the Archie Bunker of bluegrass myself – old, jaded,
and cynical about everything. But it was neat to be genuinely surprised
by someone as real as Alan Jackson – there’s no cheese about him,
nothing fake at all.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Adam said that recording and performing with Jackson
gave him a chance to see how the big dogs roll, not unlike his time
touring with the Dixie Chicks several years ago.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s the other side of life… like winning something on <em>Wheel Of Fortune</em>. You won a trip to Acapulco!”</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s hope there will be many more chances for Steffey, and all the bluegrass pickers on <em>The Bluegrass Album,</em> to be treated like stars.</p>                  </div>
