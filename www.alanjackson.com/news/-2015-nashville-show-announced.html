Jackson&rsquo;s tour is an extension of the already year-long 25th anniversary celebration which kicked off this summer with the opening of his exhibit at the Country Music Hall of Fame&reg;&nbsp;and Museum, <em>Alan Jackson: 25 Years of Keepin&rsquo; It Country</em>, which will run through March 2015. This month the multi-platinum selling Grammy winner is also playing two record-breaking sold out shows at the Country Music Hall of Fame&rsquo;s CMA Theater making him the first simultaneous artist-in-residence and major museum exhibit subject.&nbsp;<br />

<br />
<strong>About Jeff Foxworthy</strong><br />
Jeff Foxworthy is one of the most respected and successful comedians in the country.&nbsp; He is the largest selling comedy-recording artist in history, a multiple Grammy Award nominee and best selling author of more than 26 books.&nbsp; Widely known for his redneck jokes, his act goes well beyond that to explore the humor in everyday family interactions and human nature, a style that has been compared to Mark Twain&rsquo;s.<br />
<br />
Jeff may be best known as the creator and founder of the wildly successful Blue Collar Comedy Tour.&nbsp; The comedy tour spawned three concert films and a hit television show of the same name.&nbsp; Jeff has executive produced and starred in a number of television shows including &ldquo;Foxworthy&rsquo;s Big Night Out&rdquo; and the animated series &ldquo;Bounty Hunters&rdquo; for CMT.&nbsp; In addition he has filmed a number of comedy specials for HBO, Showtime, and Comedy Central.<br />
<br />
Jeff has hosted several game shows and award shows including three seasons of <em>The American Bible Challenge</em> and the hit show <em>Are You Smarter Than A 5th Grader</em>, which is coming back to FOX in 2015. &nbsp;&nbsp;Jeff was nominated for a 2014 daytime Emmy award for Best Game Show Host and in his first foray into television he was bestowed with a People&rsquo;s Choice Award as &ldquo;Favorite Male Newcomer&rdquo; for <em>The Jeff Foxworthy Show</em>.&nbsp; He also received a CMA nomination in 2001 for Broadcast Personality of the Year for&nbsp; <em>The Foxworthy Countdown</em>, a weekly syndicated four-hour radio show, which ran for ten years and was carried in over two hundred and twenty markets.<br />
<br />
Jeff&rsquo;s bestselling books include the children&rsquo;s books, <em>Dirt On My Shirt</em>, and <em>Hide!!!</em>&rdquo; which won a 2011 Mom&rsquo;s Choice Award for illustrated children&rsquo;s books.&nbsp; Both books were on the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller list.&nbsp; He has voiced a number of different characters in children&rsquo;s movies including Handy Smurf in<em> The Smurfs</em> and <em>The Smurfs 2</em>, the voice of Reggie the Rooster in the Warner Bros. film <em>Racing Stripes</em>,&nbsp; and&nbsp; Lyle in the Disney movie <em>Fox and The Hound II</em>.<br />
<br />
Due to the huge success of merchandising and licensing of his name and signature phrase You Might Be A Redneck If&hellip;, Jeff started his own outdoor company, <strong>Foxworthy Outdoors</strong>.&nbsp; The company has a line of products related to the outdoor lifestyle.&nbsp; In addition to all of this Jeff has his own line of food products, including Jeff Foxworthy&rsquo;s Grit Chips.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>About Jon Pardi&nbsp;</strong><br />
California native and Capitol Records rising country star Jon Pardi released his debut album, <em>Write You A Song</em>, on Jan. 14, 2014.&nbsp; The release features his Gold-certified Top 10 tune &ldquo;Up All Night,&rdquo; along with hits &ldquo;What I Can&rsquo;t Put Down,&rdquo; &ldquo;Missin&rsquo; You Crazy&rdquo; and his brand new &ldquo;When I&rsquo;ve Been Drinkin.&rsquo;&rdquo; Pardi has a laid back, fun-loving approach towards life and it comes through in his music and his raucous live show.&nbsp;His charisma and authenticity strike a chord with county audiences, as he wins over fans one-by-one and show-by-show.<br />
<br />
Pardi&rsquo;s sound is undeniably country &mdash; paying homage to some of his musical heroes such as Dwight Yoakam, George Strait and Alan Jackson.&nbsp; Discovering his ability for performance back at the tender age of three when he sang ALABAMA, Alan Jackson and Hank Williams, Jr. karaoke with his grandmother, Pardi has since shared the stage with Dierks Bentley, Luke Bryan, Eric Church and many more of today&rsquo;s hottest country artists.&nbsp; For additional information, visit <a href="https://t.e2ma.net/click/onrqk/wh0nak/sqskod">www.JonPardi.com</a>.<br />
