She loves a violin, I love a fiddle<br />
We go separate ways but we meet in the middle<br />
Don’t see eye to eye but were hand in hand<br />
A blue blooded woman and a red neck man<br /><br />

The lady I love loves silk and satin<br />
She was raised uptown with a silver spoon<br />
Well, I was born on a farm just south of Jackson<br />
We had an old Ford tractor and a country moon<br /><br />

She loves a violin, I love a fiddle<br />
We go separate ways but we meet in the middle<br />
Don’t see eye to eye but were hand in hand<br />
A blue blooded woman and a redneck man<br /><br />

She’s Saks Fifth Avenue perfection<br />
Caviar and dignified<br />
Well, I live my life in Wal-mart fashion<br />
And I like my sushi southern fried<br /><br />

She loves a violin, I love a fiddle<br />
We go separate ways but we meet in the middle<br />
Don’t see eye to eye but were hand in hand<br />
A blue blooded woman and a redneck man<br /><br />

She loves a violin, I love a fiddle<br />
We go separate ways but we meet in the middle<br />
Don’t see eye to eye but were hand in hand<br />
A blue blooded woman and a redneck man<br /><br />

She’s a blue blooded woman, I’m a red neck man. <br /><br />

Cowboys don’t cry, and heroes don’t die<br />
Good always wins, again and again<br />
Love is a sweet dream that always comes true<br />
Oh, if life were like the movies, Id never be blue<br /><br />

Chorus<br />
But here in the real world<br />
Its not that easy at all<br />
cause when hearts get broken<br />
Its real tears that fall<br />
And darlin’ its sad but true<br />
But the one thing I’ve learned from you<br />
Is how the boy don’t always get the girl<br />
Here in the real world<br /><br />

I gave you my love, but that wasn’t enough<br />
To hold your heart when times got rough<br />
And tonight on that silver screen<br />
It’ll end like it should<br />
Two lovers will make it through<br />
Like I hoped we would<br />
Repeat<br /><br />

Repeat chorus<br />

No, the boy don’t always get the girl<br />
Here in the real world<br /><br />

Excuse me, ma’am, can you help me<br />
I need to place an ad with you today<br />
No ma’am, tomorrow may be too late<br />
Id like to have it started right away<br /><br />

What’s that, no this is personal<br />
I’m not buying or selling anything<br />
Yes ma’am, I know just what to say<br />
I wrote it down, this is how it should read<br /><br />

Wanted one good-hearted woman<br />
To forgive imperfection in the man that she loved<br />
Wanted just one chance to tell her<br />
How much he stills loves her<br />
He can’t be sorry enough<br /><br />

What’s that, no that’s all I want to say<br />
I just hope these few lines will get to her<br />
Yes ma’am, she means everything<br />
And I hope she comes back when she reads these words<br /><br />

Wanted<br /><br />

Daddy won a radio<br />
Tuned it to a country show<br />
I was rockin’ in the cradle <br />
To the cryin’ of a steel guitar<br />
Mama used to sing to me<br />
Taught me that sweet harmony<br />
Now she worries ‘cause she never thought<br />
I’d ever really take it this far<br /><br />

Singin’ in the bars <br />
Chasin’ that neon rainbow<br />
Livin’ that honky tonk dream<br />
All I’ve ever wanted<br />
Is too pick this guitar and sing<br />
Just trying to be somebody<br />
Just wanna be heard and seen<br />
Chasin’ that neon rainbow<br />
Livin’ that honky tonk dream<br /><br />

An atlas and a coffee cup<br />
Five pickers in an old Dodge truck<br />
Heading down to Houston for a show on Saturday night<br />
This overhead is killin’ me<br />
Half the time I sing for free<br />
But when the crowd’s into it<br />
Lord it makes this thing I’m doing seem right<br />
Standin’ in the spotlight<br /><br />

Chorus<br /><br />

Daddy’s got a radio<br />
He won it thirty years ago<br />
He said “Son I just now we’re gonna hear you singin’ on it someday” <br />
I made it up to Music Row<br />
But Lordy don’t the wheels turn slow <br />
Still I wouldn’t trade a minute <br />
And I wouldn’t have it any other way<br /> 
Just show me to the stage<br />

Has it been ten years<br />
Since we said “I do” <br />
I’ve always heard marriage made one seem like two<br />
But you’re looking better than you did back then<br />
You still make this old heart give in<br /><br />

And if I had it to do all over<br />
I’d do it all over again<br />
If tomorrow I found one more chance to begin<br />
I’d love you all over again<br /><br />

The preacher man said “Til death do us part” <br />
That seemed like forever to a young man’s heart<br />
Now the days seem much shorter<br />
The longer we love<br />
And the memories just keep adding up<br /><br />

Chorus<br /><br />

If tomorrow I found one more chance to begin<br />
I’d love you all over again<br /><br />

Don’t rock the jukebox<br />
I wanna hear some Jones cause<br /> 
My heart ain’t ready<br />
For the Rolling Stones<br />
I don’t feel like rockin’<br />
Since my baby’s gone<br />
So don’t rock the jukebox<br />
Play me a country song<br /><br />

Before you drop that quarter<br />
Keep one thing in mind<br />
You got a heartbroke hillbilly<br />
Standing here in line<br />
I’ve been down and lonely<br />
Ever since she left<br />
Before you punch that number<br />
Could I make one request<br /><br />

Chorus<br /><br />

I ain’t got nothin’<br />
Against rock and roll<br />
But when your heart’s been broken<br />
You need a song that’s slow<br />
There ain’t nothing like a steel guitar<br />
To drown a memory<br />
Before you spend your money baby<br />
Play a song for me<br /><br />

Chorus<br /><br />

Don’t rock the jukebox<br />
Play me a country song<br /><br />

She looked me in the eye and said it’s over<br />
I can’t take this heartache anymore<br />
She said don’t tell me lies and try to please me<br />
I’ve heard it all so many times before<br /><br />

I took her by the arm and said don’t leave me<br />
There’s nothin’ in this world I wouldn’t do<br />
Just give me time I’ll be the man you’ve needed<br />
She said I wish that I could take that for the truth<br /><br />

And I said someday<br />
I’ll get my life straight<br />
And she said it’s too late<br />
What’s done is done<br />
And I told her someday<br />
She said I can’t wait<br />
Cause sometimes someday just never comes<br /><br />

She said all I’ve ever wanted was to love you<br />
And somewhere deep inside me I still do<br />
But now I think its time I stopped believin’<br />
Cause I’m never gonna see a change in you<br /><br />

And I said someday<br />
I’ll get my life straight<br />
And she said it’s too late<br />
What’s done is done<br />
And I told her someday<br />
She said I can’t wait<br />
Cause sometimes someday just never comes<br /><br />

Sometimes someday just never comes <br /><br />

Dallas packed her suitcase<br />
And drove off in the brand new car I bought her<br />
She made leaving me look easy<br />
I wish she’d made it look a little harder<br />
I took her out of Texas<br />
When she was just a girl<br />
But old Tennessee and me<br />
Couldn’t take Texas out of her<br /><br />

On how I wish Dallas was in Tennessee<br />
If I could move Texas east<br />
Then she’d be here with me<br />
Then nothin’ else would come between the two of us<br />
If Dallas was in Tennessee<br /><br />

By now she’s leaving Memphis<br />
And everything we had behind her<br />
Lord I hope the gold band on her hand<br />
Will serve as a reminder<br />
That true love is a treasure<br />
That’s very seldom found<br />
But you can’t stay together if there’s no common ground<br /><br />

On how I wish Dallas was in Tennessee<br />
If I could move Texas east<br />
Then she’d be here with me<br />
Then nothin’ else would come between the two of us<br />
If Dallas was in Tennessee<br />
Oh if Dallas was in Tennessee<br /><br />

Dallas packed her suitcase<br />
And drove off in the brand new car I bought her<br /><br />

Midnight in Montgomery, silver eagle, lonely road<br />
I was on my way to mobile for a big New Years Eve show<br />
I stopped for just a minute to see a friend outside of town<br />
Put my collar up, I found his name and felt the wind die down<br />
And a drunken man in a cowboy suit took me by surprise<br />
Wearing shiny boots, a nude suit and haunting haunted eyes<br />
He said friend it’s good to see you, it’s nice to know you care<br />
Then the wind picked up and he was gone or was he ever really there<br /><br />

It’s midnight in Montgomery<br />
Just hear that whippoorwill<br />
See the stars light up the purple sky<br />
Feel that lonesome chill<br />
When the wind its right you’ll hear his song<br />
Smell whiskey in the air<br />
Midnight in Montgomery<br />
He’s always singing there<br /><br />

I climbed back on my eagle <br />
Took one last look around<br />
Through red taillights<br />
A shadow moved slow across the ground<br />
Off somewhere a midnight train is slowly passing by<br />
And I could hear that whistle moaning<br />
I’m so lonesome I could cry<br /><br />

It’s midnight in Montgomery<br />
Just hear that whippoorwill<br />
See the stars light up the purple sky<br />
Feel that lonesome chill<br />
When the wind its right, you’ll hear his songs<br />
Smell whiskey in the air<br />
Midnight in Montgomery<br />
He’s always singing there<br />
He’s always singing there<br /><br />

Hank’s always singing there<br /><br />

I called my doctor on the telephone<br />
Help me Doc, there’s something wrong<br />
I can’t shake it it’s gone too far<br />
He said, tell me what your symptoms are<br /><br />

I said my hands are sweaty and my knees are weak<br />
I can’t eat and I can’t sleep<br />
It’s turning me every way but loose<br />
He said it sounds like love’s got a hold on you<br />
No doubt love’s got a hold on you<br /><br />

I told my buddies I was settlin’ down<br />
No more of this running ‘round<br />
They looked at me like I was a fool<br />
And said, come on tell us what’s wrong with you<br /><br />

Chorus<br /><br />

Well I tossed and turned til the morning light<br />
Holding my pillow hanging on for life<br />
There ain’t nothing I can do<br />
They said it sounds like love’s got a hold on you<br />
Sounds like love’s got a hold on you<br />

This old bar stools feeling higher<br />
As a started sinkin’ lower<br />
The minute that she waltzed right through that door<br />
Not long ago I held her, like a fool I went and left her<br />
Now she's with somebody new out on that floor<br /><br />

She's got the rhythm and I’ve got the blues<br />
She's showin’ me how much I had to lose<br />
With her every little move she's tellin’ me I’m over you<br />
She's got the rhythm and I got the blues<br /><br />

Well that music's gettin' louder<br />
As my heart keeps beatin' faster<br />
As she spells out regret in perfect time<br />
Well I thought I wanted freedom but that ball and chain I need them<br />
Cause when you choose sometimes you lose the prize<br /><br />

Chorus<br /><br />

She’s got the rhythm and I got the blues<br />
She’s showin’ me how much I had to lose<br />
Wither her every little move she’s tellin’ me I’m over you<br />
She’s got the rhythm and I’ve got the blues<br /><br />

With her every little move she’s tellin’ me I’m over you<br />
She’s got the rhythm and I’ve got the blues <br /><br />

Our room was filled with silence<br />
I guess we’d said it all<br />
I don’t know when Id seen our bedroom<br /> 
So long I can’t recall<br /><br />

Wed built this thing between us<br />
I’m not sure what the cause<br />
So I swallowed all my pride<br />
And tonight I climbed the wall<br /><br />

Makin’ love is so much sweeter<br />
When you love the one you hold<br />
After all these years of holdin’ her <br />
You’d think by now I’d know<br /><br />

Now as we lie here together<br />
All our troubles seem so small<br />
Just these satin sheets between us<br />
Cause tonight I climbed the wall<br /><br />

Tonight I climbed the wall <br />
And took her by the hand <br />
We’d come too far to fall<br />
Couldn’t stand to see it end<br />
So tonight I climbed the wall<br /><br />

Tonight I climbed the wall<br />
Tonight I climbed the wall<br /><br />

Way down yonder on the Chattahoochee<br />
It gets hotter than a hoochie coochie<br />
We laid rubber on the Georgia asphalt<br />
We got a little crazy but we never got caught<br /><br />

Down by the river on a Friday night<br />
Pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight<br />
Talking ‘bout cars and dreamin’ bout women<br />
Never had a plan just a livin’ for the minute<br /><br />

Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee<br />
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me<br />
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was<br />
A lot about livin’ and a little ‘bout love<br /><br />

Well we fogged up the windows in my old Chevy<br />
I was willing but she wasn’t ready<br />
So a settled for a burger and a grape sno-cone<br />
Dropped her off early but I didn’t go home<br /><br />

I’d go downtown and buy a Mercury or two<br />
Crazy ‘bout a Mercury<br />
Lord, I’m crazy ‘bout a Mercury<br />
I’m gonna buy me a Mercury <br />

Well, the girl I love<br />
I stole her from a friend<br />
He got lucky, stole her back again <br />
She heard he had a Mercury<br />

Ridin’ round in your Mercury ‘49<br />

Bought herself a Mercury, come a cruisin’ home<br />
She’s crazy ‘bout a Mercury<br />

A stark-naked light bulb hangs over my head<br />
There’s one lonely pillow on my double bed<br />
I’ve got a ceiling, a floor and four walls<br />
Who says you can’t have it all<br /><br />

My rooms decorated with pictures of you<br />
Your letters wallpaper this shrine to the blues<br />
I’ve got precious memories at my beck and call<br />
Who says you can’t have it all<br /><br />

I’ve got everything a broken heart needs<br />
I’m doing fine don’t you worry ‘bout me<br />
‘Cause I’m lord and master<br />
Of a fools Taj Mahal<br />
Who says you cant have it all<br /><br />

Chorus<br /><br />

Oh who says you can’t have it all<br /><br />

Well I'm a-gonna raise a fuss, I'm gonna raise a holler<br />
About workin' all summer just to try an' earn a dollar<br />
Everytime I call my baby, to try to get a date<br />
My boss says, "No dice, son, you gotta work late"<br />
Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do<br />
'Cause there ain't no cure for the summertime blues<br /><br />

Well my mom 'n' papa told me, "Son, you gotta make some money<br />
If you wanna use the car to go ridin' next Sunday"<br />
Well I didn't go to work, told the boss I was sick<br />
"Now you can't use the car 'cause you didn't work a lick"<br />
Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do<br />
'Cause there ain't no cure for the summertime blues<br /><br />

I'm gonna take two weeks, gonna have a vacation<br />
I'm gonna take my problem to the United Nation<br />
Well I called my congressman and he said quote<br />
"I'd like to help you son, but you're too young to vote"<br />
Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do<br />
'Cause there ain't no cure for the summertime blues<br /><br />

Well I'm a-gonna raise a fuss, I'm gonna raise a holler<br />

She's been playin' in a room on the Strip<br />
For ten years in Vegas<br />
Every night she looks in the mirror<br />
And she only ages<br />
She's been readin' about Nashville and all the records that everybody's buying<br />
Says 'I'm a simple girl myself grew up on Long Island'<br />
So she packs her bags to try to her hand<br />
Says this might be my last chance<br /><br />

She's gone country, look at them boots<br />
She's gone country, back to her roots<br />
She's gone country, a new kind of suit<br />
She's gone country, here she comes<br /><br />

Well the folk scene’s dead, but he's holding out in the village<br />
He's been writing songs, speaking out against wealth and privilege<br />
He says I don’t believe in money, but a man could make him a killin'<br />
'Cause some of that stuff don't sound much different than Dylan<br />
I hear down there it's changed you see<br />
They're not as backward as they used to be<br /><br />

He's gone country, look at them boots<br />
He's gone country, back to his roots<br />
He's gone country, a new kind of suit<br />
He's gone country, here he comes<br /><br />

Well, he commutes to L.A., but he's got a house in the valley<br />
But the bills are piling up, and the pop scene just ain't on the rally<br />
And he says honey I'm a serious composer schooled in voice and composition<br />
But with the crime and the smog these days this ain't no place for children<br />
Lord it sounds so easy, this shouldn't take long<br />
Be back in the money in no time at all'<br /><br />

Chorus<br /><br />

Yeah he's gone country, a new kind of walk<br />
He's gone country, a new kind of talk<br />
He's gone country, look at them boots<br />
He's gone country, oh back to his roots<br /><br />

He's gone country<br />
He's gone country<br />
Everybody's gone country<br />
Yeah we've gone country<br />
The whole world's gone country<br /><br />

I stare out the window at this long interstate<br>
Backed up in traffic, I just sit here and wait<br>
And dream of wide-open spaces, no fences or gates<br>
But this is the 90’s, guess I was just born too late<br><br>

The smog from the city, it sure burns my eyes<br>
Sometimes I wonder just how we’ll survive<br>
We keep runnin’ faster but are we losing the race<br>
Well I guess I’m old fashioned, just born too late<br><br>

Chorus: <br><br>

Just born too late<br>
For these modern days<br>
I should have lived<br>
Before microwaves<br>
I’m like an endangered species<br>
Just captured by fate<br>
But I have no choice<br>
I was just born too late<br><br>


This built in computer tells me how far I’ve been<br>
Another advancement of this age we live in<br>
But it can’t change a scenery or help me escape<br>
The constant reminder that I was just born too late<br><br>

Chorus: <br><br>

I was just born too late<br>
For these modern days<br>
I should have lived<br>
Before microwaves<br>
I’m like an endangered species<br>
Just captured by fate<br>
But I have no choice<br>
I was just born too late<br><br>

No I have no choice, I was just born too late<br><br>

I’ve watched you hide the pain too many times<br>
Much too often you don’t say what’s in your heart<br>
But you don’t have to say it’s over, I can see it in your eyes<br>
Cause if tears could talk, you just said goodbye<br><br>

Without a word, you took our picture from the wall<br>
And your dresses from the closet down the hall<br>
When I tried to talk it over, you just turned away and cried<br>
But if tears could talk, you just said goodbye<br><br>

And if mirrors spoke they’d tell me I’m a fool<br>
For never loving you the way I wanted to<br>
And if silence says it all I guess it means our love has died<br>
And if tears could talk, you just said goodbye<br><br>

And if mirrors spoke they’d tell me I’m a fool<br>
For never loving you the way I wanted to<br>
And if silence says it all I guess it means our love has died<br>
And if tears could talk, you just said goodbye<br>
Oh if tears could talk, you just said goodbye<br><br>

There are stars<br>
In the Southern sky<br>
Southward as you go<br>
There is moonlight<br>
And moss in the trees<br>
Down the Seven Bridges Road<br><br>

Now I have loved you like a baby<br>
Like some lonesome child<br>
And I have loved you in a tame way<br>
And I have loved you wild<br><br>

Sometimes there's a part of me<br>
Has to turn from here and go<br>
Running like a child from these warm stars<br>
Down the Seven Bridges Road<br><br>

There are stars in the Southern sky<br>
And if ever you decide<br>
You should go<br>
There is a taste of thyme sweetened honey<br>
Down the Seven Bridges Road<br><br>

Two young people without a thing<br />
Say some vows and spread their wings<br />
Settle down with just what they need<br />
Livin’ on love<br /><br />

She don’t care 'bout what’s in style<br />
She just likes the way he smiles<br />
It takes more than marble and tile<br />
Livin’ on love<br /><br />

Livin’ on love, buyin’ on time<br />
Without somebody nothing ain’t worth a dime<br />
Just like an old fashioned story book rhyme<br />
Livin’ on love<br />
It sounds simple that’s what you're thinkin'<br />
But love can walk through fire without blinkin'<br />
It doesn’t take much when you get enough<br />
Livin' on love<br /><br />

Two old people without a thing<br />
Children gone but still they sing<br />
Side by side in that front porch swing<br />
Livin’ on love<br />
He can’t see anymore<br />
And she can barely sweep the floor<br />
Hand in hand they'll walk through that door<br />
Just livin’ on love<br /><br />

Chorus<br /><br />

No it doesn’t take much when you get enough<br />
Livin' on love<br /><br />

Well I was sittin’ in a roadhouse down on highway 41<br />
You were wipin’ off some ketchup on a table that was done<br />
I know you didn't see me I was in a corner booth<br />
Of course you weren't my waitress mine was missing her front tooth<br /> 
So I flagged you down for coffee but I couldn't say a thing <br />
But I'm in love with you baby and I don't even know your name<br /><br />

I'm in love with you baby, I don't even know your name<br />
I've never been to good at all these sexual games<br />
So maybe it's just better if we leave it this way<br />
I'm in love with you baby and I don't even know your name<br /><br />

So I ordered straight tequila a little courage in a shot<br />
I asked you for a date and then I asked to tie the knot<br />
I got a little wasted, yeah I went a little far<br />
But I finally got to hug you when you helped me to my car<br />
The last thing I remember I heard myself say<br />
I'm in love with you baby I don't even know your name<br /><br />

Chorus<br /><br />

The next thing I remember, I was hearing wedding bells<br />
Standing by a woman in a long white lacy veil<br />
I raised the veil, she smiled at me without her left front tooth<br />
And I said where the heel am I and just who the hell are you<br />
She said I was your waitress and our last name's now the same<br />
Cause I’m married to you baby and I don't even know your name<br /><br />

Yeah I'm married to a waitress I don't even know her name<br />
I've never been to good at all these sexual games<br />
I never thought my love life would quite turn out this way<br />
Hey I'm married to a waitress and I don't even know her name<br /><br />

Here we are<br />
Talkin' bout forever<br />
Both know damn well<br />
It's not easy together<br /><br />

We've both felt love<br />
We've both felt pain<br />
I'll take the sunshine<br />
Over the rain<br /><br />

And I'll try<br />
To love only you<br />
And I'll try<br />
My best to be true<br />
Oh darlin', I'll try<br /><br />

So I'm not scared<br />
It's worth a chance to me<br />
Take my hand<br />
Let's face eternity<br /><br />

Well I can't tell you<br />
That I'll never change<br />
But I can swear <br />
That in every way<br /><br />

Chorus<br /><br />

I'm not perfect<br />
Just another man<br />
But I will give you<br />
All that I am<br /><br />

Chorus<br /><br />

I'll try<br />
To be true to you<br />
I'll try<br />
I'll try<br />
To always love you<br />
I'll try<br /><br />

In a small town down in Georgia over forty years ago<br />
Her maiden name was musick when she met that jackson boy<br />
They married young like folks did then, not a penny to their name<br />

Should always stay that same<br /><br />

On the land his daddy gave them a foundation under way<br />
For a love to last forever or until their dying day<br />
They built a bond that’s strong enough to stand the test of time<br />
And a place for us to turn to when our lives were in a bind<br /><br />

And they made their house from a tool shed, grandaddy rolled down on two logs<br />
And they built walls all around it and they made that house a home<br />
They taught us bout good living<br />
They taught is right and wrong<br />
Lord there’ll never be another place in this world <br />
That Ill call home<br /><br />

My momma raised five children, four girls then there was me<br />
She found her strength with faith in God and love of family<br />
She never had a social life, home was all she knew<br />
Except the time she took a job to play a bill or two<br /><br />

My daddy skinned his knuckles on the cars that he repaired<br />
He never earned much money, but he gave us all he had<br />
He never made the front page but he did the best he could<br />
And folks drove their cars from miles around<br />
To let him look underneath the hood<br />
Chorus<br /><br />

No there’ll never be another place in this world that I’ll call home<br /><br />

Have a little love on a little honeymoon<br />
You got a little dish and you got a little spoon<br />
A little bitty house and a little bitty yard<br />
Little bitty dog and a little bitty car<br /><br />

Well, it's alright to be little bitty<br />
Little hometown or a big old city<br />
Might as well share, might as well smile<br />
Life goes on for a little bitty while<br /><br />

A little bitty baby in a little bitty gown<br />
It'll grow up in a little bitty town<br />
Big yellow bus and little bitty books<br />
It all started with a little bitty look<br /><br />

Chorus<br /><br />

You know you got a job and a little bitty check<br />
Six pack of beer and television set<br />
Little bitty world goes around and around<br />
Little bit of silence and a little bit of sound<br /><br />

A good ole boy and a pretty little girl<br />
Start all over in a little bitty world<br />
A little bitty plan and a little bitty dream<br />
It's all part of a little bitty scheme<br /><br />

Everywhere you look you can write a book<br />
On the trouble of a woman and a man<br />
But you can not impose you can't stick your nose<br />
Into something that you don't understand<br /><br />

But still you wonder<br />
Who's cheatin' who, who's being true<br />
Who don't even care anymore<br />
It makes you wonder<br />
Who's doing right with someone tonight<br />
And who's car is parked next door<br /><br />

I thought I knew her well I really couldn't tell<br />
That she had another lover on her mind<br />
You see it felt so right when she held me tight<br />
How could I be so blind<br /><br />

Chorus<br /><br />

A heart is on the line each and every time<br />
Love is stolen in the shadows of the night<br />
Though it's wrong all along it keeps going on<br />
As long as you keep in out of sight<br /><br />

And you sneak up from<br />
Behind and whisper my name<br /><br />

There goes your paralyzin’ eyes<br />
There goes your tantalizin’ smile<br />
There goes my act of playin’ it cool<br />
And there go the words<br />
I meant to say<br />
There go the games <br />
I wanted to play<br />
There goes my heart fallin’ for you<br /><br />

Well I think you're playin’ with me darlin’<br />
You like to see what you can do<br />
Well I should be fishin’ for Blue Marlin<br />
Instead of bein’ hooked again by you<br /><br />

Yeah there goes your paralyzin’ eyes<br />
There goes your tantalizin’ smile<br />
There goes my heart fallin’ for you<br />

This world can take you by the hand<br />
And tempt the soul of any man<br />
But you can choose your path<br />
There's two roads you can take<br />
One way is right and one is wrong<br />
The flesh is weak but love is strong<br />
And she's all I see<br />
Between the devil and me<br /><br />

The gates of hell swing open<br />
Wide invitin' me to stop inside<br />
I'll be your friend he calls<br />
Again, I know it's him<br />
The flames are spreadin’ everywhere<br />
But through the smoke<br />
I see her there<br />
She's all I see<br />
Between the devil and me<br /><br />

I hold her in my arms tonight<br />
So safe and warm I close my eyes<br />
And a cool breeze blows<br />
'Cross our bodies in the dark<br />
Outside her reach is my concern<br />
Somewhere I know a fire burns<br />
And she's all I see<br />
Between the devil and me<br /><br />

Chorus<br /><br />

The gates of hell swing open<br />
Wide invitin' me to step inside<br />
She's all I see<br />
Between the devil and me<br /><br />

We still wear our rings<br />
We still say I love you<br />
We both play the part<br />
Oh so well<br />
But everyone knows<br />
It's just a sad show<br />
And we're only foolin’ ourselves<br /><br />

It's like living in a house with no curtains<br />
The whole world can see what's inside<br />
You can turn out the lights in a house with no curtains<br />
But the heartache has nowhere to hide<br /><br />

We could pack up and leave in different directions<br />
If we just had somewhere to go<br />
We just keep on pretending<br />
Afraid of the ending<br />
Admitting what everyone knows<br /><br />

Chorus<br /><br />

You can turn out the lights<br />
In a house with no curtains<br />
But the heartache has nowhere to hide<br /><br />

And be it the rain or the wind<br>
Or the moon up in the sky<br>
The spin of the earth<br>
Or the change of the tides<br>
I don't know what brought us together<br>
What strange forces of nature<br>
Conspire to construct the present from the past<br>

Let's begin with the day I met her<br>
And how fast this good ole boy's world got better<br>
The sky got bluer, the grass got greener<br>
Just the first few seconds after<br>
I'd first seen her<br><br>

Like my favorite song on a new set of speakers<br>
My best old jeans and my broke in sneakers<br>
A home run pitch floatin' right down the middle<br>
The sweet music made when the bow hits the fiddle<br><br>
(Chorus)<br>v
She's right on the money<br>
She goes directly to my heart<br>
And when it comes to lovin' me<br>
She's everything I need, bull's-eye perfect<br>
Oh, She's right on the money<br><br>

She's no red lights <br>
When I've overslept<br>
She's a three point jump shot<br>
That's nothing but net<br>
A hand full of aces, the dealer's done dealin'<br>
And I'm forever on a roll, that's how she's got me feeling<br><br>

(Chorus)<br><br>
She's the best cook that's ever melted cheese<br>
I ain't much around the house, but I aim to please<br>
There's absolutely no reason to doubt her <br>
When she says I wouldn't last ten minutes without her
She's<br><br>

Here I am all alone again tonight<br>
In this old empty house<br>
It's hard to learn what you don't think you need<br>
You can't live without<br>
Never leave the sound of the telephone<br>
But, ever since you left, I've been gone<br><br>

(Chorus)<br>
Gone carzy, goin' out of my mind<br>
I've asked myself the reasons, At least least thousand times<br>
Goin' up and down this hallway<br>
Tryin' to leave the pain behind<br>
Ever since you left, I've been gone<br><br>

I never saw your face this many times<br>
When you were really here<br>
The things you said I never understood<br>
Are now crystal clear<br>
I never spent this much time at home<br>

                                  <em>(Alan Jackson)</em><br><br>

I remember walkin' round the court square sidewalks<br>
Lookin' in windows at things I couldn't want<br>
There's Johnson's hardware and Morgan's jewelry<br>
And the ol' Lee King's Apothecary<br>
They ware the little man<br>
The little man<br><br>

I go back now and the stores are all empty<br>
Except for an old coke sign from 1950<br>
Boarded up like they never existed<br>
Or renovated and called historic districts<br>
There goes the little man<br>
There goes the little man<br><br>

(Chorus)<br>
Now the court square's just a set of streets<br>
That the people go round but they seldom think<br>
'Bout the little man that built this town<br>
Before the big money shut'em down<br>
And killed the little man<br>
Oh, the little man<br><br>

He pumped your gas and he cleaned your glass<br>
And one cold rainy night, he fixed your flat<br>
The new store came where you do it yourself<br>
You buy a lotto ticket and food off the shelf<br>
Forget the little man<br>
Forget about that little man<br><br>

He hung on there for a few more years<br>
But he couldn't sell slurpees and he wouldn't sell beer<br>
Now the bank rents the station to a man down the road<br>
And sell velvet Elvis and second-hand clothes<br>
There goes little man<br>
There goes another little man<br><br>

(Chorus)<br><br>

It wasn't long when I was a child<br>
An old black man came with his mule and his plow<br>
He broke the ground where we grew our garden<br>
Back before we'd all forgotten<br>
About the little man<br>
The little man<br>
Long live the little man<br>
God bless the little man<br><br>

Pop a top again<br>
I've just got time for one more round<br>
Sit 'em up my friend<br>
Then I'll be gone<br>
And then you can let some other fool sit down<br><br>

I'd like for you'd to listen to <br>
A joke I heard today<br>
From a woman who <br>
Said she was through <br>
And calmly walked away<br>
I tried to smile <br>
And did a while<br>
But it felt so outta place<br>
Did you ever hear of a clown with tearsdrops<br>
Streammin' down his face<br>

(Chorus)<br><br>

Home for me is misery<br>
And here I am wasting time<br>
'Cause a row of fools<br>
On a row of stools<br>
Is not what's on my mind<br>
But then you see <br>
Her leaving me<br>
Is not what I perfer<br>
So it's either here just drinking beer<br>
Or at home remembering her<br><br>

(Chorus)<br><br>

He's just a singer,<br>
A natural born guitar ringer<br>
Kind of a clinger to sad old songs<br>
He's not a walk-behinder,<br>
He's a new note finder<br>
His name's a reminder <br>
Of a blues man that's already gone<br><br>

So he started drinkin', took some things that messed up his thinkin'<br>
He was sure sinkin' when she came along<br>
He was born in the spot light, not to much left in sight<br>
She changed all that one night<br>
When she sang him this song<br><br>

Hey baby, I love you, Hey baby, I need you<br>
Hey baby, you ain't got to prove to me<br>
You're some kind of macho man<br>
You've wasted so much of your life<br>
Runnin' through the dark nights<br>
Let me shine a little love light <br>
Down on the blues man<br><br>

He got so sick of speedin', all things they said he was needing<br>
If he was to keep on pleasing all of his fans<br>
He got cuffed on dirt roads, he got sued over no shows<br>
She came and took that old load<br>
Down off of that blues man, and he sang<br><br>

Hey baby, I love you too<br>
Hey baby, I need you<br>
Hey baby, I do get tired of this travelin' band<br>
I'm over 40 years old now, nights would be so cold now<br>
If you hadn't stuck it out <br>
With this blues man<br><br>

He's over 40 years old now, nights would be so cold now<br>
If she hadn't hung around <br>
With that blues man<br><br>

You must be the dream, I been dreamin' of<br>
Oh what a feelin' it must be love<br><br>

Something is wrong, alright<br>
I think of you all night<br>
Can't sleep 'til morning light<br>
It must be love<br><br>

Seeing you in my dreams<br>
Holding you close to me<br>
Oh, what else can it be<br>
It must be love<br><br>

(Chorus)<br><br>

Once upon a time I was blind <br>
Hiding from the truth and the lyin’<br>
No one else could see it was clear to me <br>
No way to live without dyin’<br><br>

You wiped the pain from my eyes<br>
Dried the tears that I cried<br><br>

Chorus<br><br>

And your love gave me wings<br>
Your love gave me wings<br>
I can fly high through the storms that life brings<br>
I can do anything<br>
Cause your love gave me wings<br><br>

I was chained and more restrained<br>
The tighter the world kept on squeezin’<br>
With no one else trapped inside myself<br>
My heart had laid up on a shelf bleedin’<br><br>

But you loosened the binds<br>
And untied my mind<br><br>

Chorus<br><br>

And your love gave me wings<br>
Your love gave me wings<br>
I can fly high through the storms that life brings<br>
I can do anything<br>
Cause your love gave me wings<br><br>

Once upon a time I was blind<br>
Hiding from the truth and the lyin’<br>
With no one else trapped inside myself<br>
My heart had laid up on a shelf bleedin’<br><br>

Chorus<br><br>

But your love gave me wings<br>
Your love gave me wings<br>
I can fly high through the storms that life brings<br>
I can do anything<br>
Cause your love gave me wings<br>
Your love gave me wings<br><br>

I can fly high through the storms that life brings<br>
I can do anything<br>
Cause your love gave me wings<br>
Your love gave me wings<br>
Your love gave me wings<br>
Your love gave me wings<br>
Your love gave me wings<br>
Gave me wings<br>
Your love gave me wings<br><br>

Oh say can you see by the dawn’s early light<br>
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight’s last gleaming<br>
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight<br>
O’er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming<br>
And the rockets’ red glare, the bombs bursting in air<br>
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there<br>
O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave<br>
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave<br><br>

Well I was rollin' wheels and shiftin' gears<br />
'Round that Jersey Turnpike<br />
When Barney stopped me with his gun<br />
Ten minutes after midnight<br />
Said sir you broke the limit in that rusty ol' truck<br />
I don't know about that accent son<br />
Just where do you come from<br /><br />

I said where I come from<br />
It's cornbread and chicken<br />
Where I come from a lotta front porch sittin'<br />
Where I come from tryin' to make a livin'<br />
And workin' hard to get to heaven<br />
Where I come from<br /><br />

Well I was south of Detroit City<br />
I pulled in this country kitchen<br />
To try their brand of barbecue<br />
The sign said finger-lickin'<br />
Well I paid the tab and the lady asked me<br />
How'd I like my biscuit<br />
I'll be honest with you ma'am<br />
It ain't like mama fixed it<br /><br />

'Cause where I come from<br />
It's cornbread and chicken<br />
Where I come from a lotta front porch pickin'<br />
Where I come from tryin' to make a livin'<br />
Workin' hard to get to heaven<br />
Where I come from<br /><br />

I was chasin' sun on 101<br />
Somewhere around Ventura<br />
I lost a universal joint and I had to use my finger<br />
This tall lady stopped and asked <br />
If I had plans for dinner<br />
Said no thanks ma'am, back home<br />
We like the girls that sing soprano<br /><br />

'Cause where I come from <br />
It's cornbread and chicken<br />
Where I come from a lotta front porch sittin'<br />
Where I come from tryin' to make a livin'<br />
Workin' hard to get to heaven<br />
Where I come from<br /><br />

Well I was headed home on 65<br />
Somewhere around Kentucky<br />
The CB rang for a bobtail rig<br />
That's rollin' on like thunder<br />
Well I answered him and he asked me<br />
Aren't you from out in Tulsa<br />
No, but you might have seen me there<br />
I just dropped a load of salsa<br /><br />

Where I come from it's cornbread and chicken<br />
Where I come from a lotta back porch pickin'<br />
Where I come from tryin' to make a livin'<br />
Workin' hard to get to heaven<br />
Where I come from<br />
Where I come from<br />
Yeah where I come from<br />
A lotta front porch sitting<br />
Starin' up at heaven<br />
Where I come from<br />
Where I come from<br />
Tryin' to make a livin'<br />
Tryin' to make a livin'<br />
Oh, where I come from<br />
Where I come from<br />
Yeah, where I come from<br />
Get back down there sometime<br />
Where I come from<br /><br />

When your heart is all alone every second<br />
Seems so long<br />
When it's just you, you can't see through<br />
Those ol' clouds that rain so blue<br /><br />

But when somebody loves you<br />
There's nothing you can't do<br />
When somebody loves you<br />
It's easy to get through<br />
When somebody loves you<br />
The way I love you<br /><br />

When it's late, the sun hangs low<br />
By yourself, nowhere to go<br />
Sing a song, you dance alone<br />
Play solitaire and stare at the phone<br /><br />

Chorus<br /><br />

So let's put aside our foolish pride<br />
And let our hearts say hello<br />
We both agree we're just no good<br />
At bein' on our own<br /><br />

'Cause when somebody loves you<br />
There's nothing you can't do<br />
When somebody loves you<br />
It's easy to get through<br />
When somebody loves you<br />
The way I love you<br /><br />

The way I love you<br />
The way I love you<br /><br />

Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day<br>
Were you in the yard with your wife and children<br>
Or workin' on some stage in L.A.<br>
Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke<br>
Risin' against that blue sky<br>
Did you shout out in anger, in fear for your neighbor<br>
Or did you just sit down and cry<br><br>

Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones<br>
And pray for the ones who don't know<br>
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble<br>
And sob for the ones left below<br>
Did you burst out with pride for the red, white and blue<br>
And the heroes who died just doin' what they do<br>
Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer<br>
And look at yourself and what really matters<br><br>

(Chorus)<br>
I'm just a singer of simple songs I'm not a real political man<br>
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell you<br>
the difference in Iraq and Iran<br>
But I know Jesus and I talk to God<br>
And I remember this from when I was young<br>
Faith, hope and love are some good things He gave us<br>
And the greatest is love<br><br>

Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day<br>
Teachin' a class full of innocent children<br>
Or driving down some cold interstate<br>
Did you feel guilty 'cause you're a survivor<br>
In a crowded room did you feel alone<br>
Did you call up your mother and tell her you loved her<br>
Did you dust off that Bible at home<br><br>

Did you open your eyes and hope it never happened<br>
Close your eyes and not go to sleep<br>
Did you notice the sunset the first time in ages<br>
Or speak to some stranger on the street<br>
Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow<br>
Go out and buy you a gun<br>
Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watchin'<br>
And turn on "I Love Lucy" reruns<br>
Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers<br>
Stand in line and give your own blood<br>
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family<br>
And thank God you had somebody to love<br><br>

[Chorus x2]<br><br>

And the greatest is love<br>
And the greatest is love<br><br>

Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day<br><br>

It was painted red the stripe was white<br />
It was eighteen feet from the bow to the stern light<br />
Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta<br />
I rode up with daddy when he went there to get her<br />
We put on a shine; put on a motor<br />
Built out of love, made for the water<br />
Ran her for years, 'til the transom got rotten<br />
A piece of my childhood that will never be forgotten<br /><br />

It was just on old plywood boat<br />
With a '75 Johnson with electric choke<br />
A young boy two hands on the wheel<br />
I can't replace the way it made me feel<br />
And I would turn her sharp<br />
And I would make her whine<br />
He'd say, "you can't beat the way an old wood boat rides"<br />
Just a little lake across the Alabama line<br />
But I was king of the ocean<br />
When daddy let me drive<br /><br />

Just an old half ton shortbed ford<br />
My uncle bought new in '64<br />
Daddy got it right 'cause the engine was smoking<br />
A couple of burnt valves and he had it going<br />
He let me drive her when we'd haul off a load<br />
Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thigpen Road<br />
I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals<br />
Smiling like a hero that just received his medal<br /><br />

It was just an old hand-me-down Ford<br />
With a three-speed on the column and a dent in the door<br />
A young boy two hands on the wheel<br />
I can’t replace the way it made me feel<br />
And I would press that clutch<br />
And I would keep it right<br />
And he'd say, "a little slower son you're doing just fine"<br />
Just a dirt road with trash on each side<br />
But I was Mario Andretti<br />
When daddy let me drive<br /><br />

I'm grown up now three daughters of my own<br />
I let them drive my old Jeep across the pasture at our home<br />
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file<br />
And pull out that old memory<br />
And think of me and smile and say<br /><br />

It was just an old worn out Jeep<br />
Rusty old floorboard, hot on my feet<br />
A young girl two hands on the wheel<br />
I can't replace the way it made me feel<br />
And he'd say, "turn it left and steer it right, <br />
Straighten up girl, you're doing just fine"<br />
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride<br />
But I was high on a mountain<br />
When daddy let me drive<br /><br />

When daddy let me drive<br /><br />

Oh he let me drive<br /><br />

Daddy let me drive<br /><br />

It's just an old plywood boat<br />
With a '75 Johnson with electric choke<br /><br />

Okay I forgot about the trash<br />
I didn't trim the long hairs on my mustache<br />
I did buy you a ring I believe it was back in '93<br />
Alright I admit it I forgot our anniversary<br />
But I did pick up the baby this morning at the nursery<br />
That ain't no big thing it's a gold star for me<br /><br />

(Chorus) <br />
You get tired and disgusted with me<br />
When I can't be just what you want me to be<br />
I still love you and I try real hard<br />
I swear one day you'll have a brand new car<br />
I even asked the Lord to try to help me<br />
He looked down from heaven and said to tell you please<br />
Just be patient I'm a work in progress<br /><br />

I'm sorry I got mad waiting in the truck<br />
It seemed like hours you getting all dressed up<br />
Just to go to Shoney's on a Wednesday night<br />
I read that book you gave me about Mars and Venus<br />
I think it's sinking in but probably need to reread it<br />
But I'm starting to see now what you’ve been saying is right<br /><br />

Chorus<br /><br />

I know you meant well when you gave me those clogs<br />
But my heels sure get hot down by the muffler on my hog<br />
I'm sure they're stylish but I'll take my boots<br />
I try to do that healthy thing like you want me to do<br />
But that low fat, no fat's gettin' hard to chew<br />
Now I love your cooking honey<br />
But sometimes I need some real food<br /><br />

Chorus<br /><br />

Oh honey just be patient now<br />
I'm a work in progress. <br /><br />

If money grew on hackberry trees<br />
If time wasn't such a luxury<br />
If love was lovesick over me<br />
That'd be alright<br /><br />

If I could keep the wind in my sails<br />
Keep a hold of the tiger by the tail<br />
A half a ham sandwich in my lunch pail<br />
That'd be alright. <br /><br />

(Chorus) <br />
That'd be alright<br />
That'd be alright<br />
If everybody, everywhere<br />
Had a lighter load to bear<br />
And a little bigger piece of the pie<br />
We'd be livin' us a pretty good life<br />
And that'd be alright. <br /><br />

Go heavy on the good and light on the bad<br />
A hair more happy and a shade less sad<br />
Turn all that negative down just a tad<br />
That'd be alright. <br /><br />

If my dear ol' dog never got old<br />
If my family farm never got sold<br />
If another bad joke never got told<br />
That'd be alright. <br /><br /> 

Chorus<br /><br />

Repeat Chorus<br /><br />

That’d be alright<br />
That'd be alright<br />
That’d be alright<br />
That'd be alright<br />
That’d be alright<br />
That'd be alright<br />
Alright<br />
That’d be alright<br />
Alright<br />
That'd be alright<br />
That’d be alright<br />
That'd be alright<br /><br />

The sun is hot and that old clock is moving slow<br />
And so am I. <br />
Work day passes like molasses in the wintertime<br />
But it's July<br />
I'm getting paid by the hour, and older by the minute. <br />
My boss just pushed me over the limit<br />
I'd like to call him something, <br />
I think I'll just call it a day<br /><br />

Pour me something tall and strong<br />
Make it a Hurricane before I go insane<br />
It's only half past twelve but I don't care<br />
It's five o'clock somewhere<br /><br />

Well this lunch break is gonna take all afternoon<br />
And half the night<br />
Tomorrow morning I know there'll be hell to pay<br />
Hey, but that's alright<br />
I ain't had a day off now in over a year<br />
My Jamaican vacation's gonna start right here<br />
If the phone’s for me you can tell 'em <br />
I just sailed away<br /><br />

Chorus<br /><br />

I could pay off my tab, pour myself in a cab<br />
And be back to work before two<br />
But at a moment like this, I can't help but wonder, <br />
What would Jimmy Buffet do? <br /><br />

He’d Say<br />

Remember when I was young and so were you<br />
And time stood still and love was all we knew <br />
You were the first, so was I <br />
We made love and then you cried<br />
Remember when<br /><br />

Remember when we vowed the vows and walked the walk<br />
Gave our hearts, made the start, it was hard<br />
We lived and learned, life thru curves<br />
There was joy, there was hurt <br />
Remember when<br /><br />

Remember when old ones died and new were born<br />
And life was changed, disassembled, rearranged<br />
We came together, fell apart<br />
And broke each other’s hearts <br />
Remember when<br /><br />

Remember when the sound of little feet was the music<br />
We danced to week to week<br />
Brought back he love, we found trust<br />
Vowed we’d never give it up<br />
Remember when<br /><br />

Remember when thirty seemed so old<br /> 
Now lookin’ back, it’s just a steppin’ stone <br />
To where we are, <br />
Where we’ve been<br />
Said we’d do it all again<br />
Remember when<br /><br />

Remember when we said when we turned gray<br />
When the children grow up and move away<br />
We won’t be sad, we’ll be glad<br />
For all the life we had<br />
And we’ll remember when <br />
Remember when<br />
Remember when<br /><br />

Smiles in the mornin’ as warm as sunshine<br />
Kisses when I lay down at night <br />
And two lovin’ arms to console me <br />
I should be scared, it's so right <br /><br />

But too much of a good thing is a good thing<br /> 
Feelings like this can't be wrong <br />
And too much of a good thing is a good thing<br /> 
And we got a good thing going on <br /><br />

You look in my eyes and see my thinkin’<br />
I know when you're happy, when you're sad <br />
Some would say it's too perfect <br />
But I don't think what we have is so bad<br /><br /> 

‘Cause too much of a good thing  is a good thing <br />
Feelings like this can't be wrong <br />
And too much of a good thing  is a good thing<br /> 
And we've got a good thing going on <br /><br />

We've got a good thing going on<br /><br />

You left your Bible on the dresser<br />
so I put it in the drawer<br />
'Cause I can't seem to talk to God without yelling anymore<br />
And when I sit at your piano, <br />
I can almost hear those hymns<br />
The keys are just collecting dust but I can't close the lid<br /><br />

You left my heart as empty<br />
as a Monday morning church<br />
It used to be so full of faith and now it only hurts<br />
And I can heart the devil whisper, <br />
"Things are only getting worse"<br />
You left my heart as empty<br />
as a Monday morning church<br /><br />

The preacher came by Sunday, <br />
said he missed me at the service<br />
He told me Jesus loves me<br />
but I'm not sure I deserve it<br />
'Cause the faithful man that you loved<br />
is nowhere to be found<br />
Since they took all that he believed<br />
and laid it in the ground<br /><br />

Repeat Chorus<br /><br />

I still believe in Heaven<br />
and I'm sure you've made it there<br />
But as for me without your love, girl, <br />
I don't have a prayer<br /><br />

Repeat Chorus<br /><br />

You left your Bible on the dresser, <br />
so I put it in the drawer<br /><br />

Like red on a rose<br>
When your lips first smiled at me<br>
I was captured instantly<br>
To each his own<br>
Like blue in the sky<br>
The gaze of your willing eyes<br>
Touched something deep inside<br>
And the truth be known<br><br>

That I love you<br>
Like all little children love pennies<br>
And I love you 'cause I know that<br>
I can't do anything wrong<br>
You're where I belong<br>
Like red on a rose<br><br>

And I love you like<br>
Like all little children love pennies<br>
And I love you like<br>
Like good times of which<br>
I've known many<br>
And I love you cause<br>
'Cause I know you give me <br>
A heart of my own<br>
You make my blood flow<br>
Like red on a rose<br><br>

And I have tasted and I have wasted<br>
A woman’s love<br>

A woman’s love<br>

Of A woman’s love<br><br>

Well I have kissed it, tried to resist it<br>
I have missed a woman’s love<br>
And I have hated, taken for granted<br>
A woman’s love<br><br>

Well I have needed and I have pleaded<br>
And I have lost a woman’s love<br>
I have worshiped and I have cursed it<br>
A woman’s love<br><br>

Born the middle son of a farmer<br />
And a small town Southern man<br />
Like his daddy's daddy before him<br />
Brought up workin' on the land<br />
Fell in love with a small town woman<br />
And they married up and settled down<br />
Natural way of life if you're lucky<br />
For a small town Southern man<br /><br />

First there came four pretty daughters<br />
For this small town Southern man<br />
Then a few years later came another<br />
A boy, he wasn't planned<br />
Seven people livin' all together<br />
In a house built with his own hands<br />
Little words with love and understandin'<br />
From a small town Southern man<br /><br />

Chorus: <br />
And he bowed his head to Jesus<br />
And he stood for Uncle Sam<br />
And he only loved one woman<br />
(He) was always proud of what he had<br />
He said his greatest contribution<br />
Is the ones he'll leave behind<br />
Raised on the ways and gentle kindness<br />
Of a small town Southern man<br />
(Raised on the ways and gentle kindness) <br />
(Of a small town Southern man) <br /><br />

Callous hands told the story<br />
For this small town Southern man<br />
He gave it all to keep it all together<br />
And keep his family on his land<br />
Like his daddy, years wore out his body<br />
Made it hard just to walk and stand<br />
You can break the back<br />
But you can't break the spirit<br />
Of a small town Southern man<br /><br />

(Repeat Chorus) <br /><br />

Finally death came callin'<br />
For this small town Southern man<br />
He said it's alright 'cause I see angels<br />
And they got me by the hand<br />
Don't you cry, and don't you worry<br />
I'm blessed, and I know I am<br />
'Cause God has a place in Heaven<br />
For a small town Southern man<br /><br />

(Repeat Chorus) <br /><br />

Raised on the ways and gently kindness<br /> 
Of a small town southern man<br /><br />

Work, work all week long<br />
Punchin’ that clock dusk till dawn. <br />
Counting the days ‘til Friday night<br />
That’s when all the conditions are right. <br />
For a good time<br />
I need a good time. <br /><br />

Yeah I’ve been working all week<br />
And I’m tired and I don’t wanna sleep<br />
I wanna have fun<br />
It’s time for a good time<br /><br />

I cashed my check, cleaned my truck<br />
Put on my hat, forgot about work<br />
Sun going down, head across town<br />
Pick up my baby and turn it around<br />
Good time, <br />
Oh, I need a good time<br /><br />

Chorus<br /><br />

Pig in the ground, beer on ice<br />
Just like ole Hank taught us about<br />
Singing along, Bocephus songs<br />
Rowdy friends all night long<br />
Good time<br />
Lord, we’re having a good time, <br /><br />

Chorus<br /><br />

Whew<br /><br />

Heel to toe do-si-do<br />
Scootin’ our boots, swingin’ doors<br />
B & D Kix and Dunn<br />
Honkin’ tonk heaven, Double shotgun<br />
Good time, <br />
Lord, we’re having a good time<br /><br />

Chorus<br /><br />

Shot of Tequila, beer on tap<br />
Sweet southern woman set on my lap<br />
G with an O, O with a D<br />
T with an I , M and an E<br />
Good time<br />
Good time<br /><br />

Chorus<br /><br />

A Shot of Tequila. <br />
Beer on tap. <br />
A good looking woman. <br />
To set on my lap. <br /><br />

A G with an O, an O with a D<br />
A T with an I an M with an E<br />
That spells good time<br />
A good time<br /><br />

Chorus<br />

Twelve o’clock, two o’clock three o’clock four<br />
Five o’clock we know were that’s gonna go<br />
Closin’ the door, shuttin’ em down<br />
Head for that Waffle House way across town<br />
A Good time<br /><br />

Repeat Chorus x3<br /><br />

Oh we need a good time <br />
I need a good time<br />
Yeah a good time<br /><br />

Excuse me ma’am, I saw you walkin’<br />
I turned around, I’m not a stalker<br />
Where you going? Maybe I can help you<br />
My tank is full, and I’d be obliged to take you<br /><br />

‘Cause I’m a country boy, I’ve got a 4-wheel drive<br />
Climb in my bed, I’ll take you for a ride<br />
Up city streets, down country roads<br />
I can get you where you need to go<br />
’cause I’m a country boy<br /><br />

You sure look good, sittin’ in my right seat<br />
Buckle up, I’ll take you through the five speeds<br />
Wind it up, or I can slow it way down<br />
In the woods or right uptown<br /><br />

Repeat Chorus<br /><br />

Big 35’s whinin’ on the asphalt<br />
Grabbin’ mud, and slingin’ up some red dirt<br />
’cause I’m a country boy<br /><br />

My muffler’s loud, dual Thrush tubes<br />
I crank the music, the tone gets real good<br />
Let me know when we’re gettin’ close<br />
You can slide on out, or we can head on down the road<br /><br />

Repeat Chorus<br /><br />

Bucket seats, soft as baby’s new butt<br />
Lockin’ hubs, that’ll take you through a deep rut<br /><br />

Repeat chorus x2<br /><br />

Yeah, I'm a country boy, <br />
Oh, I'm just a country boy, <br />
A nice little country boy. <br /><br />

                                  <em>(Alan Jackson)</em><br><br>

Why did she have to go <br />
So young I just don't know why<br /> 
Things happen half the time <br />
Without reason without rhyme<br />
Lovely, sweet young woman<br />
Daughter, wife and mother<br />
Makes no sense to me<br />
I just have to believe<br /><br />

She flew up to Heaven on the wings of angels<br />
By the clouds and stars and passed where no one sees<br />
And she walks with Jesus and her loved ones waiting<br />
And I know she's smiling saying<br />
Don't worry 'bout me<br /><br />

Loved ones she left behind<br />
Just trying to survive <br />
And understand the why<br />
Feeling so lost inside<br />
Anger shot straight at God<br />
Then asking for His love<br />
Empty with disbelief <br />
Just hoping that maybe<br /><br />

Chorus<br /><br />

It's hard to say goodbye<br />
Her picture in my mind<br />
Will always be of times I'll cherish<br />
And I won't cry 'cause<br /><br />

Chorus<br /><br />

Don't worry 'bout me<br />
Don`t worry 'bout me<br /><br />

Love is hard<br>
Hard to find<br>
Hard to handle<br>
And to give up when you know that it feels right<br>
Yeah Love is hard<br>
Hard to live with<br>
Hard to deny<br>
Or understand when you’re lonely late at night<br><br>

Chorus:<br><br>

You can blame it on the whiskey<br>
You can blame it on the money<br>
You can blame it on fate or time or the fact that she ain’t funny<br>
You can blame it on her mama, on her daddy or her brother<br>
But the fact is, bottom line, simple basic truth<br><br>

Love is hard<br>
To believe in<br>
Hard to predict<br>
To forget if you’ve ever seen it once<br>
Yeah love is hard<br>
Hard to hold onto<br>
Hard to let go<br>
Or tear down when you build one strong as steel<br><br>

Chorus:<br><br>

You can blame it on the whiskey<br>
You can blame it on the money<br>
You can blame it on fate or time or the fact that she ain’t funny<br>
You can blame it on her mama, on her daddy or her brother<br>
But the fact is, bottom line, simple basic truth<br>
Love is hard<br><br>

Love is hard<br>
Hard to forgive<br>
Hard to take another chance<br>
When the last one didn’t last<br>
Yeah love is hard<br>
Hard everyday<br>
Hard to spread like cold peanut butter on a slice of fresh white bread<br><br>

Chorus:<br><br>

You can blame it on the whiskey<br>
You can blame it on the money <br>
You can blame it on fate or time or the fact that she ain’t funny<br>
You can blame it on her mama, on her daddy or her brother<br>
But the fact is, bottom line, simple basic truth<br>
Love is hard<br>
Love is hard<br>
Oh it’s so hard<br><br>

I left my home in Georgia<br>
Took a dream and a dollar<br>
Went looking for that fortune and fame<br>
Well I found it up in Nashville<br>
With the guitars and the fiddles<br>
Started singing ‘cross the U.S. of A<br>
I’d played my songs in Georgia<br>
Way down there in Florida<br>
Once or twice in New Orleans<br>
But the sounds I was making<br>
Didn’t know that I’d be taking them to places that’s so far and strange<br>
But the people really dug it no matter where we strummed it<br>
I felt that it would be ok<br>
Cause I learned right away<br>
It ain’t just a southern thang<br><br>

Chorus:<br><br>

Now I’ve played in Chicago and Western Colorado<br>
And we kicked ‘em dead in Sante Fe<br>
Sung in North and South Dakota<br>
And Eastern Oklahoma<br>
And a TV show out in LA<br>
They got the hats and boots<br>
And them country roots<br>
No matter what state they claim<br>
Yeah the facts are plain<br>
It ain’t just a southern thang, y’all<br><br>

I’ve seen cowgirls a plenty<br>
Up in New York City<br>
Milwaukee and in Philly PA<br>
They got the four wheel drives on that Minnesota ice<br>
Just like they have in Alabam A<br>
They’re dancing and they’re moving<br>
To the lyrics and the music<br>
From Maui up to Bangor Maine<br>
Lord it may sound strange<br>
But it ain’t just a southern thang<br><br>

Chorus:<br><br>

Yeah I’ve played up in Chicago and Western Colorado<br>
And we kicked ‘em dead in Sante Fe<br>
Sung in North and South Dakota<br>
And Eastern Oklahoma<br>
And a TV show out in LA<br>
They got the hats and boots<br>
And them country roots<br>
No matter what state they claim<br>
The facts are plain <br>
It ain’t just a southern thang<br><br>

I’ve played that country music<br>
On the land and the ocean<br>
But people can’t say my name<br>
Yeah the fact remains<br>
It ain’t just a southern thang<br><br>

Chorus:<br><br>

Oh I’ve played up in Chicago and Western Colorado<br>
And we kicked ‘em dead in Sante Fe<br>
Sung in North and South Dakota<br>
And Eastern Oklahoma<br>
And a TV show out in LA<br>
They got the hats and boots<br>
And country roots<br>
No matter what state they claim<br>
The facts are plain<br>
It ain’t just a southern thang<br>
Oh it may sound strange<br>
It ain’t just a southern thang<br>
Yeah the fact remains<br>
It ain’t just a southern thang, y’all<br><br>
